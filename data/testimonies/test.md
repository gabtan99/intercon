name: Chris Fisher
message: I am a Doctor of Chiropractic from America practicing in Quezon City in the
  Philippines. Intercon Regenerative Center is just the place I have been searching
  for to help myself, as well as my patients. I found the staff to be friendly, accommodating
  and knowledgeable and felt like I was their only client with the attention and time
  I got from them.
