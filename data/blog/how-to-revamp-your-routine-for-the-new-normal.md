This long into quarantine, many of us have gotten used to hitting the snooze button.

Who am I kidding? I haven’t even set an alarm since February.

Life has fallen off the rails quite a bit due to [COVID-19](https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-covid-19), but for me, sleeping in has been a small silver lining in the storm.

I’m not alone. Now that home is work and work is home for many, work and sleep can pretty much happen — whenever, wherever.

Data collected by health analytics company [Evidation Health](https://evidation.com/news/covid-19-pulse-first-data-evidation/) suggests that since quarantine began, Americans have increased their time asleep by 20 percent.

According to Dr. Richard Bogan, medical director of SleepMed of South Carolina and President of [Bogan Sleep Consultants](http://www.bogansleep.com/), it’s a much deserved rest that a great deal of us really need.

“Sleep is fundamentally and biologically necessary,” says Bogan. “You have to sleep. The better quality, quantity, and continuity of the sleep, the better the brain works. You remember better, your mood is better, your motivation and your immune system is better.”

According to Bogan, about 40 percent of the population suffers from a [lack of sleep](https://www.healthline.com/health/can-you-die-from-lack-of-sleep). It’s a [sleep debt](https://www.healthline.com/health/dr/sleep-deprivation/sleep-debt) that some of us are working hard to repay during quarantine, with cat naps and sleeping in on the daily.

Getting repaid for our debt sounds great, but it’s _how_ that really matters.

## The new sleep landscape

Prior to stay-at-home orders, most of us slept according to our circadian rhythm, or internal clock, says Bogan. The circadian rhythm is what tells our body when to be awake and when to be sleepy in regular intervals.

Rolling with your circadian rhythm works when you have a structured wake-up time, a place to be, and a formalized schedule to keep.

In the wild west of quarantine — where work and life are not held to a strict timetable — some are shucking circadian rhythm for a process called “free running.”

When free running, the body goes rogue from its 24-hour circadian rhythm.

“With free running we are seeing one of two things happening: People are sleeping when they get sleepy, and/or simply waking up whenever they wake up. The brain doesn’t like to do that,” says Bogan.

Some states are beginning to reopen, and with these open doors comes the dawn light of the new normal. We aren’t in quarantine anymore, Toto, and our new routines are still being defined.

Industrial organizational psychologist and Marian University Professor [Dr. David Rusbasan](https://www.marian.edu/academics/office-of-graduate-studies/master-of-science-in-counseling/faculty/david-rusbasan-ph-d) expects [remote work](https://www.healthline.com/health/working-from-home-tips) to become much more common.

“I think one of the larger changes that will come is a greater normalization of telework and telecommunication,” says Rusbasan. “Leaders and managers have now had a front-seat view of how telework can succeed within their organizations. I believe moving forward they will utilize the concept to a larger and more pervasive extent.”
