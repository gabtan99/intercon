question: What do I need to tell the members of my treatment team?
answer: You should tell them anything you think is relevant to your care. They need
  to know how you’re feeling, and how that changes from day to day. They need to know
  your medical history, your family’s medical history, your current prescriptions,
  and any allergies.
