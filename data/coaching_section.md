## Overview

In Functional Medicine, micro-planning is a tool used to visualize and focus attention on the steps needed for clients to reach their goals. As Holly suggests, dividing your day into four parts on a piece of paper. While it might seem like a small detail, micro-planning can play a huge role in maintaining motivation over time.

## About the Coaching Process

[A Functional Medicine Certified Health Coach (FMCHC)](https://functionalmedicinecoaching.org/why-fmca/) partners with individuals and groups in a client-centered process to support better health. FMCA trains our graduates to work closely with clients around all of the lifestyle factors (sleep/relaxation, exercise/movement, nutrition, stress, and relationships) that influence health. Coaching concepts like motivational interviewing, character strengths, and positive psychology enable health coaches to create the connection, trust, and rapport that facilitate lasting change. The coaching process is successful because it empowers clients to draw on internal strengths, develop self-knowledge, and embrace self-management strategies in order to make the often-challenging lifestyle changes necessary for optimal health.

An FMCHCâ€™s solid understanding of the foundations of Functional Medicine informs their approach. They are fully trained to utilize many of the resources provided by The Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM), such as the Timeline, Matrix, and Food Plans. Their background in Functional Medicine, combined with their training in positive psychology coaching skills, allows coaches to understand and support clients as they implement Functional Medicine treatment plans into their lifestyles. In this way, coaches [move beyond the diagnosis-prescription model](https://functionalmedicinecoaching.org/why-hire-a-health-coach-2019/) to co-create and execute a plan with the client that inspires them to a path of better health. When working under the delegation of the treating practitioner, an FMCHC may be able to provide further assistance related to labs and supplements. An FMCHC does not assess, prescribe, diagnose, treat, or interpret results.
