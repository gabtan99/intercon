introduction: Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically
  thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great,
  having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.

history: "While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of
  protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain
  a healthy body. You don’t need to eliminate certain categories of food from your
  diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category.\n\nProtein gives
  you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive
  function. Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the
  latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially
  as we age. That doesn’t mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based
  sources of protein each day can ensure your body gets all the essential protein
  it needs.\n\nFat. Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and
  increase your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart.
  In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and emotional
  health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve your mood, boost
  your well-being, and even trim your waistline.\n\nFiber. Eating foods high in dietary
  fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can help you stay regular and
  lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can also improve your
  skin and even help you to lose weight.\n\nCalcium. As well as leading to osteoporosis,
  not getting enough calcium in your diet can also contribute to anxiety, depression,
  and sleep difficulties. Whatever your age or gender, it’s vital to include calcium-rich
  foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and get enough magnesium and
  vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job.\n\nCarbohydrates are one of your body’s
  main sources of energy. But most should come from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables,
  whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and refined carbs. Cutting back on white
  bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar, fluctuations
  in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline. "
benefits:
  introduction: Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition.
    You don’t have to be perfect, you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you
    enjoy, and you don’t have to change everything all at once—that usually only leads
    to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.

  summary: A better approach is to make a few small changes at a time. Keeping your
    goals modest can help you achieve more in the long term without feeling deprived
    or overwhelmed by a major diet overhaul. Think of planning a healthy diet as a
    number of small, manageable steps—like adding a salad to your diet once a day.
    As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices.
