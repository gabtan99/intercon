preview_description: Red light therapy involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized
  room or tube. Our blood carries this oxygen throughout your body. This helps fight
  bacteria and stimulate the release of substances called growth factors and stem
  cells, which promote healing.

introduction: |-
  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized room or tube. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a well-established treatment for decompression sickness, a hazard of scuba diving. Other conditions treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy include serious infections, bubbles of air in your blood vessels, and wounds that won't heal as a result of diabetes or radiation injury.

  In a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, the air pressure is increased to three times higher than normal air pressure. Under these conditions, your lungs can gather more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.

  Your blood carries this oxygen throughout your body. This helps fight bacteria and stimulate the release of substances called growth factors and stem cells, which promote healing.

history: |-
  The first documented used of hyperbaric therapy actually came before the discovery of oxygen. In 1662, British clergyman named Henshaw, used a system of organ bellows to change the atmospheric pressure in a sealed chamber called a domicilium. This domicilium could create both hyperbaric and hypobaric environments. Despite lacking any scientific basis for his theories, Henshaw believed that acute conditions would benefit from increased air pressure, while chronic conditions would respond better to decreased air pressure. According to Henshaw, “In times of good health this domicilium is proposed as a good expedient to help digestion, to promote insensible respiration, to facilitate breathing and expectoration, and consequently, of excellent use for the prevention of most afflictions of the lungs.” Henshaw was only providing increased and decreased air pressure without increasing oxygen concentration. Oxygen was not discovered until 1773 by Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and the term “oxygen” was not coined until 1777 by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier.

  Nearly two centuries later, in the 1830’s, there was a rebirth of interest in hyperbaric medicine in France. In 1834, French physician Junod built a hyperbaric chamber to treat pulmonary afflictions using pressures of 2-4 ATA and reported increased circulation to the internal organs, improvements in cerebral blood flow, and production of feelings of well-being. Then, in 1837, Pravaz built the largest hyperbaric chamber of that time and was used to treat patients with pulmonary conditions including tuberculosis, laryngitis, tracheitis and pertussis, as well unrelated conditions such as cholera, conjunctivitis, deafness, menorrhagia and rickets.

  In 1860, the first hyperbaric chamber on the North American continent was constructed in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. A year later, Corning built the first hyperbaric chamber in the United States in New York.

  introduction: |-
    Your body's tissues need an adequate supply of oxygen to function. When tissue is injured, it requires even more oxygen to survive. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen your blood can carry. An increase in blood oxygen temporarily restores normal levels of blood gases and tissue function to promote healing and fight infection.

    Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat several medical conditions. And medical institutions use it in different ways. Your doctor may suggest hyperbaric oxygen therapy if you have one of the following conditions:
  benefits_list:
  - benefit: Bubbles of air in your blood vessels (arterial gas embolism)
  - benefit: Burn
  - benefit: Deafness, sudden
  - benefit: Gangrene

    therapy can effectively treat the following conditions:'
  conditions_list:
  - condition: Radiation injury
  - condition: Crushing injury
  - condition: Carbon monoxide poisoning
stats:
  intro: Pure oxygen can cause fire if a spark or flame ignites a source of fuel.
    Because of this, you can't take items such as lighters or battery-powered devices
    into the hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber. In addition, to limit sources of excess
    fuel, you may need to remove hair and skin care products that are petroleum based
    and potentially a fire hazard. Ask a member of your health care team for specific
    instructions before your first hyperbaric oxygen therapy session.

  summary: |-
    To benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy, you'll likely need more than one session. The number of sessions depends on your medical condition. Some conditions, such as carbon monoxide poisoning, might be treated in three visits. Others, such as nonhealing wounds, may require 20 to 40 treatments.

    Hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone can often effectively treat decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism and severe carbon monoxide poisoning.

    To effectively treat other conditions, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan and administered with other therapies and drugs that fit your individual needs.
