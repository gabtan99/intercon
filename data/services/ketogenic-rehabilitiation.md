introduction: The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb, high-fat diet that shares many
  similarities with the Atkins and low-carb diets. It involves drastically reducing
  carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your
  body into a metabolic state called ketosis. When this happens, your body becomes
  incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in
  the liver, which can supply energy for the brain. Ketogenic diets can cause massive
  reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones,
  has numerous health benefits.

history: |-
  There are several versions of the ketogenic diet.

  Standard ketogenic diet (SKD): This is a very low-carb, moderate-protein and high-fat diet. It typically contains 75% fat, 20% protein and only 5% carbs.

  Cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD): This diet involves periods of higher-carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high-carb days.

  Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD): This diet allows you to add carbs around workouts.

  High-protein ketogenic diet: This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more protein. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein and 5% carbs.

  However, only the standard and high-protein ketogenic diets have been studied extensively. Cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets are more advanced methods and primarily used by bodybuilders or athletes. The information in this article mostly applies to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), although many of the same principles also apply to the other versions.
benefits:
  introduction: |-
    The ketogenic diet actually originated as a tool for treating neurological diseases such as epilepsy.

    Studies have now shown that the diet can have benefits for a wide variety of different health conditions.
  benefits_list:
  - benefit: Parkinson's Disease
  - benefit: Epilepsy
  - benefit: Alzheimer's Disease
  - benefit: Cancer
  - benefit: Heart disease
conditions:
  introduction: Any food that is high in carbs should be limited.
  conditions_list:
  - condition: 'Fruit: All fruit, except small portions of berries like strawberries.'
  - condition: 'Grains or starches: Wheat-based products, rice, pasta, cereal, etc.'
  - condition: 'Sugary foods: Soda, fruit juice, smoothies, cake, ice cream, candy,
      etc.'
stats:
  intro: A ketogenic diet can help you lose much more weight than a low-fat diet.
    This often happens without hunger.
  stats_list:
  - content: Another study found that people on the ketogenic diet lost 3 times more
      weight than those on the diet recommended by Diabetes UK.

  - content: One study found that people on a ketogenic diet lost 2.2 times more weight
      than those on a calorie-restricted low-fat diet. Triglyceride and HDL cholesterol
      levels also improved.
