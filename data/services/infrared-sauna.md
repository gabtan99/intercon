title: Infrared Sauna
preview_description: Infrared sauna involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized
  room or tube. Our blood carries this oxygen throughout your body. This helps fight
  bacteria and stimulate the release of substances called growth factors and stem
  cells, which promote healing.

introduction: |-
  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized room or tube. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a well-established treatment for decompression sickness, a hazard of scuba diving. Other conditions treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy include serious infections, bubbles of air in your blood vessels, and wounds that won't heal as a result of diabetes or radiation injury. putang

  In a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, the air pressure is increased to three times higher than normal air pressure. Under these conditions, your lungs can gather more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.

  Your blood carries this oxygen throughout your body. This helps fight bacteria and stimulate the release of substances called growth factors and stem cells, which promote healing.

history: |-
  The first documented used of hyperbaric therapy actually came before the discovery of oxygen. In 1662, British clergyman named Henshaw, used a system of organ bellows to change the atmospheric pressure in a sealed chamber called a domicilium. This domicilium could create both hyperbaric and hypobaric environments. Despite lacking any scientific basis for his theories, Henshaw believed that acute conditions would benefit from increased air pressure, while chronic conditions would respond better to decreased air pressure. According to Henshaw, “In times of good health this domicilium is proposed as a good expedient to help digestion, to promote insensible respiration, to facilitate breathing and expectoration, and consequently, of excellent use for the prevention of most afflictions of the lungs.” Henshaw was only providing increased and decreased air pressure without increasing oxygen concentration. Oxygen was not discovered until 1773 by Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and the term “oxygen” was not coined until 1777 by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier.

  Nearly two centuries later, in the 1830’s, there was a rebirth of interest in hyperbaric medicine in France. In 1834, French physician Junod built a hyperbaric chamber to treat pulmonary afflictions using pressures of 2-4 ATA and reported increased circulation to the internal organs, improvements in cerebral blood flow, and production of feelings of well-being. Then, in 1837, Pravaz built the largest hyperbaric chamber of that time and was used to treat patients with pulmonary conditions including tuberculosis, laryngitis, tracheitis and pertussis, as well unrelated conditions such as cholera, conjunctivitis, deafness, menorrhagia and rickets.

  In 1860, the first hyperbaric chamber on the North American continent was constructed in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. A year later, Corning built the first hyperbaric chamber in the United States in New York.

    Your body's tissues need an adequate supply of oxygen to function. When tissue is injured, it requires even more oxygen to survive. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen your blood can carry. An increase in blood oxygen temporarily restores normal levels of blood gases and tissue function to promote healing and fight infection.

    Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat several medical conditions. And medical institutions use it in different ways. Your doctor may suggest hyperbaric for these benetifs:

  intro: There is no one answer for the amount of sessions per week, but infrared
    saunas are safe to use every day. In fact, you will see wellness improvements
    sooner if you use it daily. On average, most people partake in 30-45 minute sessions,
    3-4 times a week.
  stats_list:
  - content: Traditional saunas use either wood stoves or 220-V heaters to heat the
      air to approximately 85°C, which then heats the occupant, mainly via convection.
      Some people find this heat uncomfortable. In contrast, FIRSs heat to approximately
      60°C, providing a more comfortable and relaxing experience. They utilize 120-V
      infrared elements, similar to the infrared warmers on neonatal resuscitation
      beds, to radiate heat with a wavelength of around 10 μm (Figure 12). As infrared
      heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air, users develop a more vigorous sweat
      at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas. The cardiovascular
      demand imparted by thermoregulatory homeostasis (sweating, vasodilation, decreased
      afterload, increased heart rate, increased cardiac output) is similar to that
      achieved by walking at a moderate pace. As such, FIRS might be of particular
      benefit to those who are sedentary due to various medical conditions, such as
      osteoarthritis or cardiovascular or respiratory problems.
