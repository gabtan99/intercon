  Athletes need to take care of their bodies. In this world, everything can be happy. This is where you take
  out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog
  around and all that so. With practice comes confidence. Everything is happy if you
  choose to make it that way. Don't fight it, use what happens. God gave you this
  gift of imagination. Use it.
